			<h3>Origins</h3>
			<p>By no means am I a "big city" kid... if anything I could be called the opposite! I come from the small town, </p>
			<a href="http://www.lebanonpa.org/Pages/Default.aspx" target="_blank" >Lebanon County</a>
			<p>in central Pennsylvania.<br /></p>
			<h3>Grade School</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My adventure through </p>
			<a href="http://www.clsd.k12.pa.us/CCHigh.cfm?subpage=34622" target="_blank" >Cedar Crest High School</a>
			<p> in Lebanon County was a unique one. Even in elementary school, I was always taking advanced class, especially in mathematics. Middle School is where my love for science began. Simple science fair projects seemed like chores at first, until I discovered I could learn about anything I wanted to. I didn't need school to teach me about something -- an important thought at an early time in my life. From then on, I have been venturing into unfamiliar topics to learn about anything that came to my mind.<br /></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personality diversified significantly through high school, as most kids' does. I began playing Lacrosse in 8th grade and became enthusiastic with the sport, spending most of my summers in different States playing in Lacrosse tournaments. I was never exceptionally good, but I was able to become captain of my High School's team during my senior year and was among the top points scorers on my team. I even earned an award for being an exceptional student athlete that same year. Although this was a huge portion of my life, my curiosity for learning consumed much of my free time.<br /></p>
			<h3>The Science of Computers</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime during 10th grade, I took a course entitled "Intro to C". To be completely honest, I didn't know a single thing about computer science. Sure, I played my fair share of video games so I knew it existed, but I had no idea how it happened or who wrote the programs. Even from the first day in that class, learning about variables if I remember correctly, I was intensely fascinated by computer science. I remember thinking all day about what we would learn about next in the my last class for the day -- Intro to C.<br /></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said before, learning more that what was taught was a huge step for me. This is where everything sort of came together (in my 16 year old eyes). I found out this wonderful graphics engine called </p>
			<a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank" >"C++ OpenGL"</a>
			<p> where I could create programs that I could interact with! For my first few months of programming, I had no clue what was really happening in the code, but I watched a few tutorials and looked around on forum websites on how to make everything work. Eventually I had a cube with several colors that rotated around and axis! When I pushed compile and everything worked as I expected, I remember this was the first time I had that feeling when you know that you did something awesome. Of course it was frustrating trying to fix all of the bugs and I am pretty sure that my program crashed after one or two rotations, but this was an important moment for me. I created something with my own hands and by my own will. I wasn't being graded on this simple cube, but I pushed myself to figure it out.<br /></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From then on, I started creating a flurry of games. Some as simple as tic tac toe or snake, and some complicated 2 dimensional platformers. The following year of 11th grade, I took a Java class. This is where everything truly took off. Java was very simple for me to understand and there were countless libraries, including the standard Swing package that would allow me to draw graphics to the screen. I was smart this time and kept a few of the games I created, so they can be seen on my </a>
			<a href="Projects.html">projects</a>
			<p> page. I continued this process through my senior year, where I was more active. <br /></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TSA or Technology Student Association was a club my High School had that was about using technology or engineering skills to compete in competitions. Luckily for me, there was a computer science competition! I competed in a couple other competitions, but the computer science competition was the most important to me. A couple friends and I created "Expansion" which is one of my most thoroughly done games. It is very simple, but was a great demonstration on the capabilities of ordinary Java and everything I had learned about for the past few years. I also created a computer science club at my High School and called it "Byte Club" (very clever, I know). <br /></p>
